# Better Ezili Totem

## NOTE: This version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0 and MelonLoader >v0.6

This mod makes Ezili's Sacrificial Totem ability live up to its name... less. But for the purposes of fun, the ability no longer drains lives in order to use, so it's no longer unusable on Impoppable and CHIMPS.

If this sounds too OP for you, the mod also generates a config file to let you alter the cooldown to bring it more in line. 

**Changelog**

v1.0.4 Updated for Mod Helper 3.0

v1.0.3 Updated for new Mod Helper

v1.0.2 Fixed v25.0 oversight

v1.0.1 Updated for Bloons TD Mod Helper Official Release
